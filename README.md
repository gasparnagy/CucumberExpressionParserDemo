# CucumberExpressionParserDemo

Tested and works with [BERP v1.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Berp/1.2.0). There is no need to create custom parser template files (`.razor` files), the ones that come with BERP should be fine.

BERP can also donwloaded from NuGet as ZIP: https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Berp/1.2.0 (the executable is within the `tools/net471` folder inside the zip).
